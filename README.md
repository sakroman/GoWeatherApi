Weather API Go Project

This project is a simple weather API implemented in Go that provides weather information for various cities. It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and serves it as JSON responses.

To try it add an api key in the .apiConfig file and go on localhost:8080/weather/(cityname)
